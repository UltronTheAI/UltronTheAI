## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Swaraj Puppalwar**, a **Full-Stack Web Developer** and the **Founder & CTO of Lioran Group**. I started my journey in tech at the age of **11**, driven by curiosity and a strong interest in how websites and applications work behind the scenes. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a deep passion for **web development**, **system design**, and building **real-world products**.

Rather than trying to do everything, I focus on being a **strong, reliable full-stack engineer**—someone who understands both frontend and backend deeply, writes clean and maintainable code, and designs systems that scale gracefully. Today, I build production-ready applications while also leading technical vision and architecture at my own company.
