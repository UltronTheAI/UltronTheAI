## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Swaraj Puppalwar**, a **Full‑Stack Web Developer** and the **Founder & CTO of Lioran Groups**. I started my journey in tech at the age of **11**, driven by curiosity and a strong interest in how websites and applications work behind the scenes. Over the years, that curiosity turned into a deep passion for **web development**, system design, and building real‑world products.

Rather than trying to do everything, I focus on being a **strong, reliable full‑stack developer**—someone who understands both frontend and backend deeply, writes clean and maintainable code, and designs systems that scale well. Today, I build production‑ready web and mobile applications while also leading technical vision and architecture at my own company.
