## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Swaraj Puppalwar**, a **Full-Stack Web Developer** and the **Founder & CTO of Lioran Group**. I started my journey in tech at the age of **11**, driven by curiosity and a deep interest in how software systems work under the hood. Over the years, that curiosity matured into a strong focus on **backend engineering, system architecture, and building production-grade platforms**.

Rather than chasing trends, I aim to be a **reliable, systems-oriented full-stack engineer**—someone who writes clean, maintainable code and designs systems that can evolve and scale without collapsing under complexity. Today, I actively build and operate real-world products while leading the technical vision at **Lioran Group**.
